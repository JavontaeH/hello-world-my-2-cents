# Travel Brochure Project

- This is a project designed by myself and some fellow NSS Cohort 55 members to design a static website that will display information about a country when visited.
- Website designed using only javascript, css, and html. (more on project requirements here: https://github.com/nss-day-cohort-51/automated-world)
- My contributions include styling and scripting work for the navbar, brainstorming design templates, sourcing images for the website to use, some other scripting found within the website, & quality control.


## Instructions for Viewing 
1. Navigate to the directory in which you want MCA to reside
1. run `git clone git@github.com:JavontaeH/hello-world-my-2-cents.git`
1. run `cd hello-world-my-2-cents`
1. run `serve` (npm package downloaded here https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) to create a local server to view the website on
1. copy % paste local port from serve command into browser 


## Difficulties:

- First ever group project working with git/github so some workflow difficulties there as well as learning on the go with CSS (specifically flexbox). First time having to dynamically inject into html using JS functions caused some difficulty as well.
